Kirti says its not dad and Dadi s mistake  its not easy to change such thinking. He says they can give it a try. She says you can t make anyone away from life  you can hurt someone if you are hurt.    He says my intentions weren t such. She says even their intentions weren t bad  they made a mistake  you don t do this mistake. He asks what shall I do. She says change their thinking by your conviction and logic. He says they won t understand. She tries to explain. She says dad is not wrong  he didn t know about that van  you could have explained him  they have always forgiven us  dad never punished you  you are not able to forgive him for one thing  its wrong to behave like this  you can t form or break relations by documents  its up to you now. She goes. Naira looks on. Lav and Kush play. The laptop falls. They worry. Kartik comes and asks what happened. They say sorry  laptop fell down  don t scold us. He asks them to stop crying and go to study. They go.    Naira asks did you forgive them. He says yes. She says mistakes can be forgiven  we need to forgive elders  how can we manage a new relation with our baby  just start practicing forgiveness. Dadi gets pandit s call. He says you didn t tell me about baby girl or boy. Dadi sees Kartik and Naira and disconnects the call. Kartik gets the laddoos jar and asks Naira to eat it. Dadi cries. Naira says I spoke to doctor  I will eat things prepared by you  Kartik and whatever I like. Kartik asks Dadi to make more ghee laddoos. Naira asks Dadi not to cry. She says you did what you have seen since childhood  its okay  many people want boy or girl  even you are right  you shouldn t impose thinking on pregnant women  from now onwards  make laddoos for my health  not to make a girl a boy.
