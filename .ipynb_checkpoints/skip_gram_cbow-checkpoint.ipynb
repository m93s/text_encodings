       " b'No translation can expect to equal, much less to excel, the original.\\n',\n",
       " b'The excellence of a translation can only be judged by noting how far it\\n',\n",
       " b'has succeeded in reproducing the original tone, colors, style, the\\n',\n",
       " b'delicacy of sentiment, the force of inert strength, the peculiar\\n',\n",
       " b'expressions native to the language with which the original is written,\\n',\n",
       " b'or whatever is its marked characteristic. The ablest can do no more, and\\n',\n",
       " b'to want more than this will be demanding something impossible. Strictly\\n',\n",
       " b'speaking, the only way one can derive full benefit or enjoyment from a\\n',\n",
       " b'foreign work is to read the original, for any intelligence at\\n',\n",
       " b'second-hand never gives the kind of satisfaction which is possible only\\n',\n",
       " b'through the direct touch with the original. Even in the best translated\\n',\n",
       " b'work is probably wanted the subtle vitality natural to the original\\n',\n",
       " b'language, for it defies an attempt, however elaborate, to transmit all\\n',\n",
       " b'there is in the original. Correctness of diction may be there, but\\n',\n",
       " b'spontaneity is gone; it cannot be helped.\\n',\n",
       " b'The task of the translator becomes doubly hazardous in case of\\n',\n",
       " b'translating a European language into Japanese, or vice versa. Between\\n',\n",
       " b'any of the European languages and Japanese there is no visible kinship\\n',\n",

       " b'It may be said that the inspiration of the two languages is totally\\n',\n",

       " b'sentiments and traits makes the work of translation all the more\\n',\n",
       " b'difficult. A novel written in Japanese which had attained national\\n',\n",

       " b'stated that \"Botchan\" by the late Mr. K. Natsume was an epoch-making\\n',\n",
       " b\"piece of work. On its first appearance, Mr. Natsume's place and name as\\n\",\n",
       " b'the foremost in the new literary school were firmly established. He had\\n',\n",
       " b'written many other novels of more serious intent, of heavier thoughts\\n',\n",
       " b'and of more enduring merits, but it was this \"Botchan\" that secured him\\n',\n",
       " b'the lasting fame. Its quaint style, dash and vigor in its narration\\n',\n",
       " b'appealed to the public who had become somewhat tired of the stereotyped\\n',\n",
       " b'sort of manner with which all stories had come to be handled.\\n',\n",
       " b'In its simplest understanding, \"Botchan\" may be taken as an episode in\\n',\n",
       " b'the life of a son born in Tokyo, hot-blooded, simple-hearted, pure as\\n',\n",
       " b'crystal and sturdy as a towering rock, honest and straight to a fault,\\n',\n",

       " b'blood-curdling scenes or nothing startling or sensational in the plot or\\n',\n",

       " b'story becomes doubly interesting by the fact that Mr. K. Natsume, when\\n',\n",
       " b'quite young, held a position of teacher of English at a middle school\\n',\n",
       " b'somewhere about the same part of the country described in the story,\\n',\n",

       " b'CHAPTER I\\n',\n",
       " b'Because of an hereditary recklessness, I have been playing always a\\n',\n",
       " b'losing game since my childhood. During my grammar school days, I was\\n',\n",
       " b'once laid up for about a week by jumping from the second story of the\\n',\n",
       " b'school building. Some may ask why I committed such a rash act. There was\\n',\n",
       " b'no particular reason for doing such a thing except I happened to be\\n',\n",
       " b'looking out into the yard from the second floor of the newly-built\\n',\n",
       " b'school house, when one of my classmates, joking, shouted at me; \"Say,\\n',\n",
       " b\"you big bluff, I'll bet you can't jump down from there! O, you\\n\",\n",
       " b'chicken-heart, ha, ha!\" So I jumped down. The janitor of the school had\\n',\n",
       " b'to carry me home on his back, and when my father saw me, he yelled\\n',\n",
       " b'derisively, \"What a fellow you are to go and get your bones dislocated\\n',\n",
       " b'by jumping only from a second story!\"\\n',\n",
       " b'\"I\\'ll see I don\\'t get dislocated next time,\" I answered.\\n',\n",
       " b'One of my relatives once presented me with a pen-knife. I was showing it\\n',\n",
       " b'to my friends, reflecting its pretty blades against the rays of the sun,\\n',\n",
       " b'when one of them chimed in that the blades gleamed all right, but seemed\\n',\n",
       " b'rather dull for cutting with.\\n',\n",
       " b'\"Rather dull? See if they don\\'t cut!\" I retorted.\\n',\n",
       " b'\"Cut your finger, then,\" he challenged. And with \"Finger nothing! Here\\n',\n",
       " b'goes!\" I cut my thumb slant-wise. Fortunately the knife was small and\\n',\n",
       " b'the bone of the thumb hard enough, so the thumb is still there, but the\\n',\n",
       " b'scar will be there until my death.\\n',\n",
       " b'About twenty steps to the east edge of our garden, there was a\\n',\n",
       " b'moderate-sized vegetable yard, rising toward the south, and in the\\n',\n",
       " b'centre of which stood a chestnut tree which was dearer to me than life.\\n',\n",
       " b'In the season when the chestnuts were ripe, I used to slip out of the\\n',\n",
       " b'house from the back door early in the morning to pick up the chestnuts\\n',\n",
       " b'which had fallen during the night, and eat them at the school. On the\\n',\n",
       " b'west side of the vegetable yard was the adjoining garden of a pawn shop\\n',\n",
       " b\"called Yamashiro-ya. This shopkeeper's son was a boy about 13 or 14\\n\",\n",
       " b'years old named Kantaro. Kantaro was, it happens, a mollycoddle.\\n',\n",
       " b'Nevertheless he had the temerity to come over the fence to our yard and\\n',\n",
       " b'steal my chestnuts.\\n',\n",
       " b'One certain evening I hid myself behind a folding-gate of the fence and\\n',\n",
       " b'caught him in the act. Having his retreat cut off he grappled with me in\\n',\n",
       " b'desperation. He was about two years older than I, and, though\\n',\n",
       " b'weak-kneed, was physically the stronger. While I wallopped him, he\\n',\n",
       " b'pushed his head against my breast and by chance it slipped inside my\\n',\n",
       " b'sleeve. As this hindered the free action of my arm, I tried to shake him\\n',\n",
       " b'loose, though, his head dangled the further inside, and being no longer\\n',\n",
       " b'able to stand the stifling combat, he bit my bare arm. It was painful. I\\n',\n",
       " b'held him fast against the fence, and by a dexterous foot twist sent him\\n',\n",
       " b'down flat on his back. Kantaro broke the fence and as the ground\\n',\n",
       " b'belonging to Yamashiro-ya was about six feet lower than the vegetable\\n',\n",
       " b'yard, he fell headlong to his own territory with a thud. As he rolled\\n',\n",
       " b'off he tore away the sleeve in which his head had been enwrapped, and my\\n',\n",
       " b'arm recovered a sudden freedom of movement. That night when my mother\\n',\n",
       " b'went to Yamashiro-ya to apologize, she brought back that sleeve.\\n',\n",
       " b'Besides the above, I did many other mischiefs. With Kaneko of a\\n',\n",
       " b'carpenter shop and Kaku of a fishmarket, I once ruined a carrot patch of\\n',\n",
       " b'one Mosaku. The sprouts were just shooting out and the patch was covered\\n',\n",
       " b'with straws to ensure their even healthy growth. Upon this straw-covered\\n',\n",
       " b'patch, we three wrestled for fully half a day, and consequently\\n',\n",
       " b'thoroughly smashed all the sprouts. Also I once filled up a well which\\n',\n",
       " b'watered some rice fields owned by one Furukawa, and he followed me with\\n',\n",
       " b'kicks. The well was so devised that from a large bamboo pole, sunk deep\\n',\n",
       " b'into the ground, the water issued and irrigated the rice fields.\\n',\n",
       " b'Ignorant of the mechanical side of this irrigating method at that time,\\n',\n",
       " b'I stuffed the bamboo pole with stones and sticks, and satisfied that no\\n',\n",
       " b'more water came up, I returned home and was eating supper when Furukawa,\\n',\n",
       " b'fiery red with anger, burst into our house with howling protests. I\\n',\n",
       " b'believe the affair was settled on our paying for the damage.\\n',\n",
       " b'Father did not like me in the least, and mother always sided with my big\\n',\n",
       " b\"brother. This brother's face was palish white, and he had a fondness for\\n\",\n",
       " b'taking the part of an actress at the theatre.\\n',\n",
       " b'\"This fellow will never amount to much,\" father used to remark when\\n',\n",
       " b'he saw me.\\n',\n",
       " b'\"He\\'s so reckless that I worry about his future,\" I often heard mother\\n',\n",
       " b'say of me. Exactly; I have never amounted to much. I am just as you see\\n',\n",
       " b'me; no wonder my future used to cause anxiety to my mother. I am living\\n',\n",
       " b'without becoming but a jailbird.\\n',\n",
       " b\"Two or three days previous to my mother's death, I took it into my head\\n\",\n",
       " b'to turn a somersault in the kitchen, and painfully hit my ribs against\\n',\n",
       " b'the corner of the stove. Mother was very angry at this and told me not\\n',\n",
       " b'to show my face again, so I went to a relative to stay with. While\\n',\n",
       " b\"there, I received the news that my mother's illness had become very\\n\",\n",
       " b'serious, and that after all efforts for her recovery, she was dead. I\\n',\n",
       " b'came home thinking that I should have behaved better if I had known the\\n',\n",
       " b'conditions were so serious as that. Then that big brother of mine\\n',\n",
       " b'denounced me as wanting in filial piety, and that I had caused her\\n',\n",
       " b'untimely death. Mortified at this, I slapped his face, and thereupon\\n',\n",
       " b'received a sound scolding from father.\\n',\n",
       " b'After the death of mother, I lived with father and brother. Father did\\n',\n",
       " b'nothing, and always said \"You\\'re no good\" to my face. What he meant by\\n',\n",
       " b'\"no good\" I am yet to understand. A funny dad he was. My brother was to\\n',\n",
       " b'be seen studying English hard, saying that he was going to be a\\n',\n",
       " b'businessman. He was like a girl by nature, and so \"sassy\" that we two\\n',\n",
       " b'were never on good terms, and had to fight it out about once every ten\\n',\n",
       " b'days. When we played a chess game one day, he placed a chessman as a\\n',\n",
       " b'\"waiter,\"--a cowardly tactic this,--and had hearty laugh on me by seeing\\n',\n",
       " b'me in a fix. His manner was so trying that time that I banged a chessman\\n',\n",
       " b'on his forehead which was injured a little bit and bled. He told all\\n',\n",
       " b'about this to father, who said he would disinherit me.\\n',\n",
       " b'Then I gave up myself for lost, and expected to be really disinherited.\\n',\n",
       " b'But our maid Kiyo, who had been with us for ten years or so, interceded\\n',\n",
       " b'on my behalf, and tearfully apologized for me, and by her appeal my\\n',\n",
       " b\"father's wrath was softened. I did not regard him, however, as one to be\\n\",\n",
       " b'afraid of in any way, but rather felt sorry for our Kiyo. I had heard\\n',\n",
       " b'that Kiyo was of a decent, well-to-do family, but being driven to\\n',\n",
       " b'poverty at the time of the Restoration, had to work as a servant. So she\\n',\n",
       " b'was an old woman by this time. This old woman,--by what affinity, as\\n',\n",
       " b\"the Buddhists say, I don't know,--loved me a great deal. Strange,\\n\",\n",
       " b'indeed! She was almost blindly fond of me,--me, whom mother, became\\n',\n",
       " b'thoroughly disgusted with three days before her death; whom father\\n',\n",
       " b'considered a most aggravating proposition all the year round, and whom\\n',\n",
       " b'the neighbors cordially hated as the local bully among the youngsters. I\\n',\n",
       " b'had long reconciled myself to the fact that my nature was far from being\\n',\n",
       " b\"attractive to others, and so didn't mind if I were treated as a piece of\\n\",\n",
       " b'wood; so I thought it uncommon that Kiyo should pet me like that.\\n',\n",
       " b'Sometimes in the kitchen, when there was nobody around, she would praise\\n',\n",
       " b'me saying that I was straightforward and of a good disposition. What she\\n',\n",
       " b'meant by that exactly, was not clear to me, however. If I were of so\\n',\n",
       " b'good a nature as she said, I imagined those other than Kiyo should\\n',\n",
       " b'accord me a better treatment. So whenever Kiyo said to me anything of\\n',\n",
       " b'the kind, I used to answer that I did not like passing compliments. Then\\n',\n",
       " b'she would remark; \"That\\'s the very reason I say you are of a good\\n',\n",
       " b'disposition,\" and would gaze at me with absorbing tenderness. She seemed\\n',\n",
       " b'to recreate me by her own imagination, and was proud of the fact. I felt\\n',\n",
       " b'even chilled through my marrow at her constant attention to me.\\n',\n",
       " b'After my mother was dead, Kiyo loved me still more. In my simple\\n',\n",
       " b'reasoning, I wondered why she had taken such a fancy to me. Sometimes I\\n',\n",
       " b'thought it quite futile on her part, that she had better quit that sort\\n',\n",
       " b'of thing, which was bad for her. But she loved me just the same. Once\\n',\n",
       " b'in, a while she would buy, out of her own pocket, some cakes or\\n',\n",
       " b'sweetmeats for me. When the night was cold, she would secretly buy some\\n',\n",
       " b'noodle powder, and bring all unawares hot noodle gruel to my bed; or\\n',\n",
       " b'sometimes she would even buy a bowl of steaming noodles from the\\n',\n",
       " b'peddler. Not only with edibles, but she was generous alike with socks,\\n',\n",
       " b'pencils, note books, etc. And she even furnished me,--this happened some\\n',\n",
       " b'time later,--with about three yen, I did not ask her for the money; she\\n',\n",
       " b'offered it from her own good will by bringing it to my room, saying that\\n',\n",
       " b'I might be in need of some cash. This, of course, embarrassed me, but as\\n',\n",
       " b'she was so insistent I consented to borrow it. I confess I was really\\n',\n",
